# **Definition of Done**

## 1. Code Finished
Code must be:
- Well-documented for ease of future changes
- Refactored to improve readability
- Peer reviewed to ensure it operates as intended


Maybe add this...
- Have a front-end that is "well-polished"
- deployed on something as well...it's a working version that can be used
- 

Unit/integration testing for all features should also be complete.

## 2. Test Finished
All necessary functional testing (both automated and manual) should be complete. Issues that were discovered should also be resolved and the product should work as desired.
