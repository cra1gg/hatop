# Unfinished Tasks
[AUT-32] Handle GET request from a student
- Reason: Schema had to be rewritten and there was not enough time to rewrite this story for the new schema

[AUT-33] Handle GET request from a teacher
- Reason: Schema had to be rewritten and there was not enough time to rewrite this story for the new schema

# Good Practices
* Having 5 standups so that everyone in the group is updated on what is happening with the project
* Using pull requests so that code can be reviewed before it gets merged to the master branch
* Tracking the progress of user stories on Jira
* Logging work in JIRA
* Breaking large user stories into smaller, more digestible subtasks
* Using Discord to communicate all major problems or updates

# Bad Practices
* Work on documentation in advance of sprint completion date
* Not moving completed stories into complete in JIRA
* Underestimating amount of time needed for completing user stories
* Realizing schema would not work right before sprint deadline

# New Practices for Next Sprint
* Make sure people working on backend consult with people working on frontend so that progress is continuous
* During standups, start discussing any challenges that hindered progress
* Make sure timing for standups are coordinated between members
* Start adding the issue ID to commit messages
* Make sure standups are planned ahead of time so members know when to inform others of their progress

# Best Experience
The best experience in sprint 2 was completing the authentication for login and signup. This helped hook the frontend to the backend and made the project more cohesive
