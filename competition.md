# **Competing Products**

# 1. [TopHat](https://tophat.com/)

### Tophat is our main competition because it is the most widely used platform in the education system. For this reason, it is vital to differentiate our product
## How is our product different?
TopHat is a product which relies on subscriptions from students to be used. We see this as unfair as it is an additional cost on top of an already hefty tuition payment. Our aim is to make our product free to use, or only impose a cost on the institution as opposed to each student. Add something else maybe

## Better for specific users/scenarios?
When answering questions in class, many students want to remain anonymous. Several key changes to the TopHat platform removed this anonymity and this [left fewer students wanting to participate](https://maxliboiron.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/barriers-to-using-top-hat.pdf). Our platform would aim to maintain the anonymity of students by not connecting their name to their answer.

# 2. [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/)
## How is our product different?
Kahoot is used more so as a game than as a method of gauging participation. Our product is marketed as a tool to help educators gauge participation in their class, by providing them with concrete and precise statistics. Kahoot is limited to multiple choice questions, our product aims to allow for both multiple choice and short answer questions. Finally, Kahoot is not necessarily linked to any particular student since students can join with any alias they choose. Our platform would connect to student accounts so that no fraud could occur. A major component of Kahoot is the speed with which a user answers a question, this (and correctness) is one of the main components of the number of points a user has. Since correctness and participation are the main metrics for our platform, we will disregard speed completely.

## Better for specific users/scenarios?
Our platform is better for teachers as it shows in-depth statistics on a per-student basis, as well as makes it easier to identify each student based on their student number. Our platform also does not necesarily reward students based on whether or not their answer is correct, but whether or not they answered.

# 3. [iClicker](https://www.iclicker.com/)
## How is our product different?
iClicker requires students to either purchase a physical clicker device, or purchase a subscription that can be used on their smartphone. iClicker also requires instructors to purchase a receiver so they can obtain the answers from students in the classroom. Our product would be completely virtual and would therefore require no hardware to be purchased by neither the students nor the instructor. On top of this, iClicker limits students and instructors to only multiple choice questions. Our platform would allow for both multiple choice and short answer questions.

# 4. [Blackboard](https://www.blackboard.com/)
## How is our product different?
Blackboard is an entire ecosystem for educational institutions, meaning all content for a given course must be administered through Blackboard (with the exception of tests and exams). To this effect, Blackboard allows instructors to post quizzes and participation activities for students to complete. Our platform would be completely standalone and would be used only as a tool for instructors to conduct participation and knowledge-testing activities on. Our platform would not support the submission of assignments or the consolidation of marks from in-class work.

# 5. [Canvas](https://canvas.instructure.com/)
## How is our product different?
Again, Canvas is an entire ecosystem for educational systems. UofT uses Canvas (previously used Blackboard) but still administers in-class activities through TopHat and other third-party platforms. 

# 6. [Moodle](https://moodle.com/)
## How is our product different?
Moodle is used primarily for instructors to host websites for a given course. Part of Moodle's functionality is allowing instructors to administer quizzes and learning activities to students. This functionality closely matches our platform's sole functionality although again, our platform would be marketed as a standalone platform with quick setup and would allow instructors to easily deploy quizzes in minutes.
