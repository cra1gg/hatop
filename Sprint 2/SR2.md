# Participants
* Davinder, Shubham, Micah, Derek, Kyle, Rahul, Craig
# Unfinished Tasks
All user stories in sprint 2 have been completed.
# Practices to Continue
* Having 5 standups so that everyone in the group is updated on what is happening with the project
* Using pull requests so that code can be reviewed before it gets merged to the master branch
* Tracking the progress of user stories on Jira
* Logging work in JIRA
* Breaking large user stories into smaller, more digestible subtasks

# New Practices for Next Sprint
* During standups, start discussing any challenges that hindered progress
* Make sure timing for standups are coordinated between members
* Use either Facebook Messenger or Discord for critical messages, but not both
* Start adding the issue ID to commit messages
* Work on documentation in advance of sprint completion date
# Best Experience
The best experience in sprint 2 was adding the navigation bar which helped connect all the pages and backend work done in sprint 1. This was the first sign of cohesiveness in the project
