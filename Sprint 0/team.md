# Guidelines:
## Methods of communication: 
* Facebook Messenger
* Discord (Backup)
* Text/SMS (backup)

All group members are present in a group conversation with each other on all three of these platforms, and are also connected with one another individually.

## Communication Response Times:
* Messenger - Less than 1 hour
* Discord - Less than 1 hour
* Text/SMS - Urgent - Less than 30 minutes

## Meeting Preparation 
* To prepare for meetings (both in-person and online), all group members should bring a list of any questions and expectations they may have.
* Group members should also have an up-to-date version of the project repository to review code during the meeting if necessary.

## Group Meetings
* Meetings will take place either face-to-face on campus or online.
* Throughout meetings, expectations for the sprint will be discussed and any progress on UserStories from individual group members will be shared. 
* Each group member should participate in discussion and share their thoughts, concerns and expectations.
* The proposed meeting schedule is as follows

* Rahul Nakre will record the minutes for each of these meetings
* Briefing meetings and midpoint meetings are used to discuss division of work, concerns, questions, and any other issues relating to the current sprint.
* Debrief meetings are used discuss any contentious points with the previous sprint, and how they can be resolved for the next sprints


## Version Control:
* Only well-documented and formatted code will be committed
* Commit any stable changes/updates to user stories on corresponding branch. (e.g. for UserStory 27, we will make changes on the branch 'UserStory27')
* Commit messages should concise, clear and written in present tense.
* Commit messages should contain a brief summary of the changes
* Only merge code from branches containing code that has been thouroughly tested.

## Roles and Division of Work:
* Each group member will develop, test and review code.
* Work will be distributed as evenly as possible among all group members. 
* User stories will be allocated according to strengths and weakneses of members.

## Submitting Sprint Deliverables and Software:
* Submissions will be done at least a two days in advance before the submission date.
* For each submission, a different group member will be responsible for submitting the work.
* Every group member who is not responsible for the submitting the work must review the submission to ensure it is correct and complete. All group members will check that all deliverables are included before the submission date.

## Contingency Planning:
* In the case that someone drops the course, that person's tasks will be redistributed equally amoung remaining group members, again contingent on strengths and weaknesses.
* In the case that any group member misses a meeting, all group members will attempt to establish contact with the offending group member, and attempt to elicit a reason. If the reason is satisfactory, the members will provide the offending member with a synopsis of the meeting as well as the minutes. Otherwise, the member will be at risk of having low peer evaulation marks. Additionally, the offending member will be expected to continue with their assigned work until all sprints have been completed. 
* In the case that any group member fails to complete a task upon an agreed upon time, again a reason will be elicited and further action will be taken. In the case that a group member is unable to complete a task on-time because of its heavy difficulty/complexity, the user story may be reassigned to another memeber, distributed amoung other group members or decomposed into multiple individual tasks. 
* In the case that any team member is academically dishonest and the issue is caught by a different group member, the offending member will be confronted and reported to the instructor or TA.
