# Unfinished Tasks
We finished all tasks we expected to.

# Good Practices
* Having 5 standups so that everyone in the group is updated on what is happening with the project
* Using pull requests so that code can be reviewed before it gets merged to the master branch
* Tracking the progress of user stories on Jira
* Logging work in JIRA
* Breaking large user stories into smaller, more digestible subtasks
* Using Discord to communicate all major problems or updates
* Informal daily meetings were a good way to quickly communicate progress on different aspects of the project.
* Keeping track of our burndown chart to make it as efficient as possible.
* Giving feedback to group members on their work.

# Bad Practices
* Work on documentation in advance of sprint completion date
* Not moving completed stories into complete in JIRA
* Underestimating amount of time needed for completing user stories
* Realizing schema would not work right before sprint deadline
* Overestimating scope and assigning too much work
* Not movinng tasks to completed or in progress

# New Practices for Next Sprint
* Make sure people working on backend consult with people working on frontend so that progress is continuous
* During standups, start discussing any challenges that hindered progress
* Make sure timing for standups are coordinated between members
* Start adding the issue ID to commit messages
* Make sure standups are planned ahead of time so members know when to inform others of their progress

# Best Experience
The best experience in sprint 4 was seeing Micah's beautiful quizbuilder because it was better than anything we had built before
