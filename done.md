# **Definition of Done**

## 1. Code Finished
Code must be documented for ease of future changes, refactored to improve readability, and peer reviewed to ensure it operates as intended. Unit/integration testing should also be complete.

## 2. Test Finished
All necessary functional testing (both automated and manual) should be complete. Issues that were discovered should also be resolved and the product should work as desired.
