* There will be a number of in-person meetings to discuss crucial project aspects before each sprint
* Rahul Nakre will be in charge of the minutes for each meeting

# Meeting Preparation
* To prepare for meetings (both in-person and online), all group members should bring a list of any questions they may have.
* Group members should also have an up-to-date version of the project repository so code can be reviewed together if needed.

# Version Control:
* Commit any major changes/updates to user stories on corresponding branch. Ex for User Story 27, branch UserStory27
* Commit messages should be present tense, contain brief summary on what was changed
* Ensure commit messages are concise and clear.
* When feature is complete and you have performed some basic tests on it, merge it with master.

# Submitting Sprint Deliverables and Software:
* Rahul Nakre will check all submissions to ensure they include all deliverables and that they are complete
* All group members will double check that all deliverables are included before submission date. 

# Contingency Planning:
* In the case that someone drops the course, that person's tasks will be redistributed equally amoung remaining group members, again contingent on strengths and weaknesses.
* In the case that any group member misses a meeting, all group members will attempt to establish contact with the offending group member, and attempt to elicit a reason. If the reason is satisfactory, the members will provide the offending member with a synopsis of the meeting as well as the minutes. Otherwise, (something about peer evaluations idk)
* In the case that any group member fails to complete a task upon an agreed upon time, again a reason will be elicited and further action will be taken. In the case that a group member is unable to complete a task on-time because of its heavy difficulty/complexity, the user story may be reassigned or distributed amoung other group members
* In the case that any team member is academically dishonest and the issue is caught by a different group member, the offending member will be confronted and reported to the instructor or TA.
