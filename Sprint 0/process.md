# Team Organization
For sprint one, Rahul will create the sign-up page and Craig will create the log-in page. Additionally, Shubham will be in charge of creating a page allowing teachers to create enrollable classes, Derek will generate the database to store the class info, and Kyle will develop the join code for each individual class. Finally, Davinder will implement code for allowing students to enroll in classes using unique join codes, and Micah will implement code to keep track of individual attendance and quiz grades.

# Decision-making
To make decisions, we conducted a vote and used the majority rule. Typically, only one round of voting was necessary for us to come to a 
consensus.

# Prioritizing User Stories
The highest priority was given to user stories about the essential and basic functions of our application. This ensures that the most 
important functions are completed first before additional features are added. The lowest priority was given to user stories about the 
user interface. These features are not required for the application to function the way it is intended to function, which makes them less 
important. We prioritized the user stories based on whether or not they are required for the application to work as desired.

# Meetings
We conducted meetings both online and in person, however most of the time we communicated using Facebook Messenger and Discord. Facebook Messenger and Discord was used because they both help facilitate the sharing of code snippets and syntax 
highlighting due to their built-in markdown support. 

We met in person every Thursday, and communicated online throughout the week.

# Next Phase
We will continue to maintain the consistent communication we have now to maximize quality and efficiency when working on the project.
