*Commit messages should be present tense, contain brief summary on what was changed
*Make sure commit messages are concise and clear.

#Roles and Division of Work:
*Work will be dividied equally amoung all group members, user stories will be allocated according to strengths and weakneses of members
*expand on this
*Micah Flemming will decide who does what because he is the tallest group member

#Submitting Sprint Deliverables and Software:
*Rahul Nakre will check all submissions to ensure they include all deliverables. All group members will double check that all deliverables are
included before submission date. 

#Contingency Planning:
*In the case that someone drops the course, that person's tasks will be redistributed equally amoung remaining group members, again contingent on strengths and weaknesses.
*In the case that any group member misses a meeting, all group members will attempt to establish contact with the offending group member, and attempt to elicit a reason. If the reason is satisfactory, the members will provide the offending member with a synopsis of the meeting as well as the minutes. Otherwise, (something about peer evaluations idk)
*In the case that any group member fails to complete a task upon an agreed upon time, again a reason will be elicited and further action will be taken. In the case that a group member is unable to complete a task on-time because of its heavy difficulty/complexity, the user story may be reassigned or distributed amoung other group members
*In the case that any team member is academically dishonest and the issue is caught by a different group member, the offending member will be confronted and reported to the instructor or TA.
