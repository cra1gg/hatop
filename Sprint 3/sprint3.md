## Goal of Sprint: 
The goal of this sprint is to complete [AUT-2], [AUT-38], [AUT-31], [AUT-11]
- **[AUT-2]** As Crangis/Harvey (a teacher) and Davinder/Anson I want to have a cohesive design that markets the product properly.
- **[AUT-11]** As Davinder/Anson (a student), I should be able to see the marks for all the quizzes/tests I've done so that I can determine my grade for that particular course.
- **[AUT-31]** As Davinder/Harvey (a student or teacher), I should be able to sign up with credentials, and then sign in with those same credentials.
- **[AUT-38]** Create and update database schemas for the application

These stories will be broken down as follows
- **[AUT-2]** 
    - **[AUT-34]** Configure navbar and other components for logged in users
    - **[AUT-35]** Clean up pages to fit design
    - **[AUT-36]** Add landing place with courselist
- **[AUT-11]** As Davinder/Anson (a student), I should be able to see the marks for all the quizzes/tests I've done so that I can determine my grade for that particular course.
- **[AUT-31]** 
    - **[AUT-37]** Use redux to store global state
- **[AUT-38]** 
    - **[AUT-39]** Create database schema for user
    - **[AUT-40]** Update database schema for a class

## Team Capacity:
* 10 ideal days x 7 team members = 70

## Spikes:
* In order to implement [AUT-2], [AUT-11], and[AUT-31], we need to remake the database scehmas as per [AUT-38]
* [AUT-38] We are not sure how long it will take to remake the database schemas
* [AUT-39] To complete the authentication, Shubham Sharma will have to learn about JWT
* In order for Craig to complete [AUT-34] and [AUT-35], Rahul Nakre and Craig will have to learn about redux global states to store whether or not user is logged in.
