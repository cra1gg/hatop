## Goal of Sprint: 
The goal of this sprint is to complete [AUT-3], [AUT-10], [AUT-26], [AUT-4], and [AUT-7]
- **[AUT-3]** As a student, I want to be able to sign in so that I can see the classes I'm currently enrolled and use the features offered (quizzes, attendance etc.).
- **[AUT-10]** As a teacher, I should be able to make quizzes that include multiple choice and true/false questions so that I can quiz the students during lecture.
- **[AUT-26]** As a teacher, I want to be able to navigate between use the navigation bar to check the student-grades/quizzes/student-list/attendance-list for a specific class.
- **[AUT-4]** As a teacher or student, I want to be able to sign out so that I can sign out of the application.
- **[AUT-7]** As a teacher, I should be able to start a quiz during lecture so that students answer the question that's currently being asked during that quiz.

These stories will be broken down as follows
- **[AUT-3]** 
    - **[AUT-28]** Reorganize backend to use mongoose and MongoDb Cloud
- **[AUT-10]** 
    - **[AUT-25]** Validate the quiz builder input and store the quiz inside MongoDB
- **[AUT-26]** As a teacher, I want to be able to navigate between use the navigation bar to check the student-grades/quizzes/student-list/attendance-list for a specific class.
- **[AUT-4]** As a teacher or student, I want to be able to sign out so that I can sign out of the application.
- **[AUT-7]** 
    - **[AUT-30]** Setup Express Route and Mongoose Schema for quizQuestion

- **[AUT-4]** - Craig D'Souza
- **[AUT-3]** - Derek Jang

## Team Capacity:
* 10 ideal days x 7 team members = 70

## Spikes:
* In order to build a navbar for [AUT-26], Craig needs to look up and understand routes and Material UI
* In order for [AUT-4] to be implemented, [AUT-26] needs to be finished
* In order for [AUT-4] to be implemented, the backend needs to be connected to both the sign-in and sign-up pages.
* In order for the signup to be connected to the MongoDB, Rahul needs to write new paths and routers.
