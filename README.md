## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). Please ensure you have version `6.13.4` or higher. To check your version:

```
npm version
```

### Installing

This project has two major components, the frontend and the backend. Both of these run independently of eachother (as per MVC guidelines). To run this project, you need to run both the frontend and the backend. 

#### Frontend
To run the frontend, navigate to the frontend folder and execute the following command

```
npm install
```

The below commands are to start the server

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

#### Backend
To run the backend, navigate to the backend folder and execute the following command

```
npm install
```

The below commands are to start the server

### `npm start`

## Interacting with the system

Once the server is up and running, you should be able to navigate to `localhost:3000` and have a local copy of the project.
