# **Reflection**

## Tools/Techniques/Conventions That Worked Well
Some of the tools and conventions we used that worked very well were daily standups on Microsoft teams, maintaining the backlog in Jira, and discussing who was better suited for specific tasks based on their past experiences with different tools. Daily standups helped us stay up to date with recent changes, maintaining the Jira backlogs helped us keep track of which tasks are in progress and which still need to be completed, and the discussions helped us maintain our velocity to ensure our project is completed on time. 

## Tools/Techniques/Conventions That Did Not Work Well
As for conventions that did not work well, scrum meetings were difficult because of the varying schedules of all the team members. Due to the many assignments from different courses throughout the semester, it was hard to come up with times that everyone could attend the meetings. The creation of independent user stories were also challenging, as it was hard to anticipate what user stories required other user stories to be completed first. 

## Ideal Process
The ideal process for our team would be to start the project by planning out the software architecture so that minimal refactoring of code is needed during the process of building the application. The next step would be to create user stories and prioritize them so that we know which user stories should be finished first. The user stories that are created should have minimal coupling so that team members donâ€™t have to wait on other tasks to be finished before starting theirs. At least 5 standups should occur in one sprint, where everyone explains what they have done and the difficulties they have faced while working on their tasks. These standups should be planned in advance so that everyone in the team can participate in the standups. Throughout each sprint, the product backlog should be maintained and Jira should be used so that every team member knows their assigned tasks and knows what user story is finished, not finished, or being worked on.
